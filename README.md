# cv

This is the repo for my CV. I admit, it is a bit overdone. But hey, it works!

## Running

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/are1000/cv2.git
    $ npm i
    $ npm start
```

Then open `localhost:1234`.

## Getting the PDF file

Just use builtin browser Print to PDF functionality. Don't forget to configure margins and other settings!
